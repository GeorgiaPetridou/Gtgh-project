# Event Management System 
team: Despoina Papadopoulou, Kerasoula Velei, Georgia Petridou

Project Overview:
This project is a comprehensive event management system designed and developed by a team of programming students. The system provides an integrated solution for managing events, approval requests, reservations, and user interactions. It supports multiple user roles, including visitors, organizers, and employees, each with tailored functionalities.

The project was a collaborative effort, showcasing the team's ability to design, develop, and deploy a robust software system using modern programming principles and tools.

Key Features:
    Event Management:
        Create, update, and delete events, 
        Search and filter events by date, location, and theme. 
    Approval System:
        Organizers can submit requests to add or delete events, 
        Employees can approve or reject these requests. 
    Reservation Management:
        Visitors can search for events, make reservations, and cancel them, 
        QR code generation for reservations. 
    User Roles:
        Visitors: Explore events and manage reservations, 
        Organizers: Manage events and submit approval requests, 
        Employees: Oversee event approval and ensure smooth operation.

Tech Stack:
    Backend: Java with Spring Boot for RESTful APIs.
    Frontend: -
    Database: -
    Version Control: Git for collaborative development.

Team Contributions:
    We decided to randomly assign a User class and a Function class to each member, So 
        Despoina: Visitor + Reservation,
        Kerasoula: Organizer + Event,
        Georgia: Employee + ApprovalRequest. 
    By the end of the project each team member would get involved in various functionalities regardless of their initial assignment.
